variable : A variable is a space in memory that can store values.

<Rules for variable naming>
1. It is case-sensitive and has no limit on length.
2. Do not use reserved words.
3. The name must not start with a number.
4. Only special characters "-" and "$" are allowed.

<variable type>
1. primitive type
- boolean : It has true or false value. It used in conditional expressions and logical calculations.
The default value is false.
- char : It stored one character per variable. Variables store Unicode characters.

- byte, short, int, long : lt stored integer variable. byte and short is used to save storage space.
long is used when dealing with numbers beyond the range of int.

- float, double : It stored real number. Float is used to increase the speed of operation or to save memory.

-The seven basic types except boolean can be computed and transformed with each other.


2.reference type
- It stored address of Object.
- Since the name of the class is used as the type of the variable, 
the name of the class becomes the type of the reference variable.

<casting>
Casting is the conversion of a variable's type to another type.
It is used to match types when computing between different types.

How to casting
- Put the type you want to convert before the variable in parentheses.

<Variable type according to declaration position>
1. class variable : All instances share a common storage space. 
Just add static before the instance variable.
2. instance variable : It is created when you create an instance of a class. 
Instance variables have independent storage space.
3. local variable : It is declared within a method and can only be used within a method.
When the method ends, it is destroyed and can not be used.
