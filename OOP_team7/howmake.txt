<Three steps of encapsulation>
1. mark all instance variables "private" so they are well hidden.

2. 
- mark getters and setters public so they can be accessed by anyone.
  (in some cases you might want to restrict this).
- The getter method is named 'get + member variable name', 
  and the setter method is named 'set + member variable name'.

3. Add guardians to setters (if needed).

* this? Means the object currently being used. 
It means 'own instance' created in memory after object orientation. 
This is typically used when the constructor or method parameter uses 
the same name as the object variable.
