[Inheritance] 
: Inheritance is the reuse of existing classes to create new classes.

- The class which inherits the properties of other is known as 
  "subclass" (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties 
   are inherited is known as "superclass" (base class, parent class).
- Subclass inherits instance variables and methods of the superclass 
  and adds some new stuff.
- The number of members in the descendant class is always equal to 
  or greater than the ancestor class.
- You can not inherit from one or more classes.
- A subclass can not access the "private, default" 
  instance variables or methods of a superclass.
- extends is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class.

<Benefits of inheritance>
1. You can write common code in the superclass to reduce duplicate code.
2. It's easy to add new common code.
 - Just add it to the subclass and it will be inherited 
   by all the subclasses.
3. The superclass allows you to define a common form for a group of classes.
 - All subclasses have the same variables and methods as the superclass.

<How to Make>
1. Put the common code in the superclass.
2. Create a subclasses that inherits the common code 
   of the superclass.
3. The name of the subclass is followed by the name 
   of the superclass with "extends".
4. Methods inherited from subclasses can now be rewritten to override!
