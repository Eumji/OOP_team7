[Encapsulation] <Data Hiding>
: A mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and 
  code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.  

- In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden 
from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods 
of their current class.

<Why use encapsulation?>
- For non-encapsulated variables, 
you can use the dot operator to change values.
- Encapsulation is used to prevent wrong people from approaching 
and changing values strangely.

Example)----------------------------------------------------
theCat.height // Variable to change the size of the cat

theCat.height = 0; 
// Without encapsulation, it is possible to change 
   the size of the cat strangely.

theCat.setHeight(25);
// By forcing them to use the setter method, 
   you can prevent cat's size from changing nonsensically.

------------------------------------------------------------

<Getter & Setter>
- Getters and setters are methods for retrieving (getter) and changing
(setter) values of instance variables.

*Getter : The getter method simply returns the value of the variable.

*Setter : The setter method is written to check the value specified 
in the parameter and to change the value of the member variable 
only when the value matches the condition.

- Also known as "accessors" (getters) and "mutators" (setters).
