<casting>
Casting is the conversion of a variable's type to another type.
It is used to match types when computing between different types.

*How to casting?
- Put the type you want to convert before the variable in parentheses.

<Variable type according to declaration position>
1. class variable
- All instances share a common storage space. 
- Just add static before the instance variable.
2. instance variable 
- It is created when you create an instance of a class. 
- Instance variables have independent storage space.
3. local variable 
- It is declared within a method and can only be used within a method.
- When the method ends, it is destroyed and can not be used.

<Variable comparison>
- Base type 
  : Base type variables can be compared with the "==" operator.
- Reference type
  1. Use equals to ensure that the two objects are equal.
  2. Use "==" to see if it refers to the same object in the heap.
