"Class" defines an object.
- Type(blueprint or model) of an object
- "Class" is used to create objects.

- Two ways to get a class
1. Use one that someone else published in the "Java Class Library" or another library.
2. Define your own class

"Object" is an instance of the class
- Many objects of the class can exist.

Instantiate : The process of creating an object from a class is called class instantiation.
instance : An object created from a class is called an instance of that class.

Class has variables and methods
- variable(State) : variable must have a type(base type or reference type)
- methods(Behavior)

<Method>
A method is a set that performs a specific action.
- main()method : Every Java program has at least one class with a main() method.
 ¡æ If a class doesn't have a main method, 
   it can be used by other classes but it cannot be executed as a program.

- The method declaration consists of a method name, a parameter declaration, 
  and a return type.
- The method provides information about what values are needed to do the job 
  and what type of value to return as a result.
- If there is no return value, void is the return type.
- In the Method Implementation section, insert the statement to be executed 
  when the method is called.
