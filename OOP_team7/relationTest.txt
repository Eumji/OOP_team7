<How to determine relationships between classes>
¡æ "IS -A" test : You can test the inheritance relationship.
ex) Cat 'is a' animal.
¡æ "HAS- A"test : You can test the composition relationship.
ex) Cat 'has a' color.

*Composition? : Composition is the declaration of a reference variable 
                of another class type as a member variable of a class.

- If one class is a more specific type of class, use inheritance.
- If there is a common behavior for several classes 
  of the same generic type, Consider inheritance.
- If it is not inheritence relatinoship, Allows you to rewrite code 
  from other classes without using inheritance.
